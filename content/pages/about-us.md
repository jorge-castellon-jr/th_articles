    column_content: '<h2>Our Mission</h2><p>Our mission is to persuade people to act,
      in all aspects of their lives, in concert with social principles that advance
      Human Happiness, Harmony and Prosperity.</p><h2>Our Vision</h2><p>To see vibrant
      communities in which the cultural norm is to rely exclusively on voluntary relationships
      in the course of advancing their personal interests and values. Individuals
      will categorically reject the use of all agents—personal, social, or political—who
      seek to initiate force or fraud on their behalf.</p><h2>Our Message: Social
      Principles</h2><ol><li><p>All living organisms, including human beings, have
      an innate drive toward greater flourishing, happiness and life satisfaction.</p></li><li><p>Physical
      harm to a person always decreases his or her opportunity to flourish, to achieve
      happiness and life satisfaction.</p></li><li><p>Stealing a person’s property
      always decreases his or her happiness or life satisfaction.</p></li></ol><h2>The
      Challenge</h2><p>Although a vast majority of individuals recognize these fundamental
      realities of human nature, too many are unaware of the ways they are disregarded
      and the negative consequences for the happiness and life satisfaction of their
      fellows.</p><p>The Foundation exists to shed light on the myriad ways institutions
      and individuals within a "society" breach these principles, and how we each
      can pursue our own happiness without violating our most valued principles.</p>'
